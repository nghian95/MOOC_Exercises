# MOOC_Exercises

# This repository includes work and exercises that I've done throughout MOOC.fi's Java Programming I & II

# It encompasses data structures, search and binary sort, inheritance, polymorphism, and more.

==================
# Part 7.5 - Searching

# Implemented a Linear and Binary Search method
==================
# Part 7.7 - RecipeSearch

# Creates a User Interface that can interact with the user to search and read for recipes
# that fit their search criteria
==================
# Part 9.4 - DifferentKindOfBoxes

# Creating subclasses that inherit an abstract class Box and implementing the abstract methods for each subclass.
==================
# Part 9.6 - InterfaceInABox

# This exercise uses interfaces to share a common method along with using polymorphism
# to allow the Box to include itself and other Packable items.
==================
# Part 9.10 - OnlineStore

# This exercise uses Maps and Lists to create a functional eCommerce Store that tracks product's prices
# and stock along with the Customer's cart. Also integrates defined equals and hashCode methods to more easily
# find products in the various Maps and Lists.
==================
# Part 10.10 - BooksFromFile

# Utilized streams to read lines from a text file, split them into array elements, and create Book objects from
# the data.
==================
# Part 12.10 - MagicSquare

# Implemented the Siamese method algorithm to create magic squares (squares that have their horizontal, vertical 
# and diagonal sums equal to one another).
